# PVT_Calculator
Black oil PVT calculator
This PVT calculator requires the latest version of Plotly and Dash
The PVT calculations are for a Black Oil: oil for which, at reservoir conditions, the solution GOR R s  < 350 m 3 /m 3  (approximately 2000 scf/STB)
The calculator uses the following correlations :
- Standing correlation for: Pb, bubble point pressure; Rs, solution gas-oil ratio, Bo, oil formation volume factor
- Vasquez and Beggs for: Co, oil compressibility above the bubble point pressure
